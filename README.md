Personal Windows AI (that will actually be helpful in daily needs!!).

### Getting Started : 
1. Install [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html?highlight=conda#regular-installation).
2. Go to this home dir, and open `cmd` or `terminal`.   
`conda env create -f freeze.yml`   
This will create a new environment named `suzu` which will include all the base packages needed.

### Features to work on : 

- Voice for the AI
- Recognition of different things
- Classification of things
- Automation of daily tasks
- setting up schedulers for the project
- QnA for the specific system information in which it is placed



### Contribution
Seriously, that would be a huge help \/.
Right now I am doing this project in my non-office hours and want to integrate so many things, like Reinforcement Learning for doing 
certain tasks faster.
Please contact me for any contribution and issues.
