Aside from just the bit about Shirogane\'s mom, we also had the interactions between Ishigami and Subject F and Iino that could potentially pop back up later and be relevant.\n\nAlso, this is a romcom manga.

[22, 12, 3, 'Shingo is the headband guy who’s been the most level headed about the situation\n\nKensuke’s perspective is important because it is somewhat true that it was just a private fight between friends that was overblown into a massive issue. While it’s true that he should have been considerate that they were in a public space, and it’s naive to think that people won’t gossip about it, it’s kind of unfair that people’s thirst for drama is what really perpetuated the rumours. Is it not valid to think that other people should be considerate and not stick their nose in/extrapolate stories from what they saw/heard of the incident?\n\nOf course him being called out is important too, as he did plenty wrong - which is normal for any violent outburst between friends. But I think the interesting thing that’s happening here is the question of what things can break a friendship, and the opinions of the reader vs the characters\n\nFor many people, Kensuke’s homophobia is enough to cut him off forever, regardless of the circumstances (islamaphpbia being a good parallel). But for whatever reason, be it his temperament or their strong friendship, Touma seems willing to keep being his friend\n\nFor some people, a violent outburst is enough to end a friendship, especially when the beliefs behind that disagreement may deeply offend the people involved. To be fair to Kensuke, he admitted he was wrong and wants to keep being friends with Touma even though he still has to work past his views on gay people. The question of ‘How can people forgive/be friends after he did something so bad’ might be totally irrelevant if Touma does forgive him. Sometimes forgiveness isn’t entirely earned in friendships, because the alternative is something no one wants\n\nFor some people, being romantically/sexually attracted to a friend is too uncomfortable for a friendship. But Mami continues to be Kensuke’s friend to this day, and we’re still waiting on the development between Touma and Taichi\n\nThe other thing to remember is these guys are high school kids. While it’s a lot easier and a somewhat adult thing to do to cut people out of your life once you’re out of school, these guys are still emotionally immature and figuring it out (which is why some leeway can be found for the historically aggressive Kensuke reacting to an unsettling situation with violence - that’s part of the tragedy) With how cliquey school can be, it’s very common for people to continue hanging out regardless of if they still enjoy their company. And Kensuke’s behaviour through the whole series has been pretty awful, so it’s not like he’s really ever been a good character. Sometimes a friend group will have people like him in it']

There’s a sub-genre of shoujo isekai web novels where the protagonist is reincarnated as the rival character in an otome game (dating sim for girls) and has to avoid the bad fate of the rival character in the game using their knowledge of the game. Usually the setting is vaguely based off of court life at the Palace of Versailles (early to mid 18th century, but you’ll never see guns), often with fantasy elements (e.g. magic). Sometimes it’s not isekai but has the same sort of setting. Sometimes the protagonist is a character adjacent to the villainess.

Additionally catching an enemy\'s throw means it doesn\'t count as a hit. In some versions the shooter is the considered hit if their throw is caught.\n\n[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisonball) is the Wikipedia article with a tons of different variations of the game. Here is the closest explanation to the one I played in middle school and elementary with my previous additions of returning to the field if you hit someone with the ball from prison.\n\n>Prisonball works essentially the same way as "Prisonball" above.[vague] However, the prison is extended to the sides of the opponent\'s court, as well as the back. No one may be released from prison, however, anyone in prison is allowed to collect balls and attack the opposite team, provided they do not enter their court. This makes for a hectic game since as players are eliminated, teams will eventually be attacked from all four sides. The last team with a member remaining not in prison wins. This variation is sometimes known as "Ghost."']

[213, 1, 1, 'This is the end of the series. It had 2 volumes in total. \n\nIf you don\'t mind me asking, what do you mean by fake for the first volume? It was never tagged with [END] as far as I remember. \n\nOr were you maybe referring to the title, because it sounded like it will include only a hundred scenes of girls love (which were covered in the first volume) and then the second volume came like a surprise.\n\nIf that\'s the case, then I can understand the confusion. The only problem was that the title is "A Hundred Scenes of Girls Love" which was covered in the first volume and the second volume is named "The four seasons of Girls Love", but is also put under the same main title "A Hundred Scenes of Girls Love" in mangadex and also in mangaupdates so it could be a bit confusing for people.\n\nThat\'s why I put volume 2 in the parentheses (Vol.2 - The four seaons of Girls Love) to make at least some kind of distinction between the volumes instead of just continuing with numbering the chapters without mentioning the second volume, so people wouldn\'t know where the new volume started (ofc unless they check it out for themselves).

This is something that always made me feel disappointed because many mangaka does those things and in 90% of the times we won't see that because no one translates.\n\nWith that said, the team of Act-Age be it the author, the artist or the editor (which I still want to know who he is and what he worked before) is quite interesting. Like you, I wish to know more as between those, we only know the artist which has 22 years and is probably the youngest on WSJ right now."]
[266, 8, 1, 'It\'s certainly an interesting case watching Yonagi\'s career unfold and manifest.\n\nHer Death Island role felt like the sort of role that one would take when first starting off your acting career, very much the CSI/NCIS/Law & Order role, where every actor has a shot at being on screen for the first time. Definitely overshadowed by Chiyoko, but still a role that doesn\'t show us enough of Yonagi\'s range to really be able to typecast her.\n\nThen Galactic Express put her in an interesting position in which she was not only genderswapped but given more range as to what she was able to perform. A much smaller audience compared to the silver screen, still noteworthy nonetheless, but doesn\'t have the ability to be mass produced and distributed the way Death Island did.\n\nYou can consider Shinjuku Girl to be her true "breakout" where she was truly in the public eye. They saw this girl going viral over essentially being herself, or who the audience perceived to be herself. A lively, captivating girl, but could easily be a fleeting moment like most things that go viral are. \n\nNow Princess Iron Fan is where it\'s going to be interesting. Because for those that have been following Yonagi for a while, such as Chiyoko, the Death Island director, Akira, etc., they know Yonagi\'s ability and range. But to this mass audience who only knows her from her viral video, her limited performance in Death Island, and now here in Princess Iron Fan, this could very well be the sort of role in which critics see her shine in one role and expect her to shine in that one role, and where casting directors will share the same mentality.\n\nI really hope that they don\'t type her as a villain. At the very least, I\'m sure Kuroyama wouldn\'t let it happen. As interesting as everything has been unfolding, I don\'t want to keep seeing Kei try to hurt herself every time to try and stay true to her roles.']

He absolutely wont be reckless like that damn woman, and will choose the proper role for her and take care of her mental health. And he has a damn big connection to do that. Except for the Iron Fan Princess, all of Yonagi's roles were handpicked and negotiated by Kuroyama himself, to facilitate her growth.

So now we get a character who raises the question "even if this relationship does succeed, do you *really* want your kid to lead a life like this?". Stacked with the flashback about Legosi\'s mother, it feels like it\'s coming on *way* too strong, and Melon\'s particular status is really his only defining character trait.\n\nRiz was interesting because he was nuts, although he didn\'t look nuts from the outside (and the whole murder mystery angle helped make his deal interesting), and the Shishigumi boss was a one-off minor antagonist who didn\'t get or need much development. Melon\'s getting a lot of time for very little development, and is too obvious of a foil for Legosi.']
[455, 12, 1, "> Damn it Police. Is there no chance Herbivore can commit the crime? Oh ya, that guy is suspicious. He is a Herbivore, let him go.\n\nConsidering that he mentioned he ate parts of his victims, I can understand why the police would immediately rule him out as a suspect as an herbivore (as long as there was no evidence directly connecting him to the crime), although I don't get why nobody ever has him take off his mask.\n\n>Haru, you are 19. If you say you stopped sleeping around 10 years ago, that means you were sleeping around when you were 9… you started to sleep around when you were 14…..\n\nDidn't she say it felt like ten years right after that? (So, not literally ten years.)\n\nAlso, we have had some discussion about how smaller animals lead shorter, faster lives - which would probably mean they hit puberty and sexual activity a lot more quickly.\n\n>Legoshi says he came here expecting a fight. 2 chapters later, ends up fighting Shishigumi\n\nFuck, you're right. That's hilarious, and I didn't notice it. Thanks for pointing it out.\n\n>Why would Hybrid be persecuted if goal is friendly relationships?\n\nRemember back near the beginning where Haru was getting bullied because she fucked a different (and rarer) breed of rabbit? Or that time Juno and Legosi went to a restaurant together and everyone was incredibly nice to them because they thought the two were a purebred wolf couple? And then there's the stipend the country pays to married couples of the same breed.\n\nIt seems that, although they might want carnivores and herbivores to be integrated, the society in general is deliberately trying to not have everybody turn into mutts even within species, and when you throw the hybrid problems Melon and Legosi's mother display into that mix, things get even worse. The komodo dragon / gray wolf mix seems like an incurable skin disease, and Melon's deal seems like being born with anhedonia. Given the entire setup, it seems reasonable for people to actively discourage hybrids and look askance at them.\n\n>Huh, did Agata forget his role in the deal, as in to comfort Louis the whole night….\n\nI think circumstances really forced everybody's hand there, since nobody wanted to eat Louis, but everybody *wanted* to eat Louis. That said, I think Louis' night has been interesting enough to take his mind off his troubles for a bit. (Fuck, I really, *really* want him to go back to being a mob boss. It'd be damn hilarious if the way this ends up is with him leaving his family, grabbing Juno, and leading the Shishigumi into an even brighter era than his first stint as their boss.)"]

You probably just see her as nothing but a love interest because that’s what your used to, but she has shown facets of her personality that have her stand out. Plus, she’s apparently got some history with a brother. And I’m not sure how you can’t call Ryu and Kotsuga entertaining, yet like the bland characters in MHA.\n\nIf disliking a series for being pushed was a valid criticism, then everyone should hate MHA. That’s been getting pushed down everyone’s throats since season 2.  And that editor thing you mentioned... how is that even a criticism? It’s a bad thing that Kishi is putting in things he likes into his manga? I swear, the haters make no sense...']

The biggest thing he did was adding sasuke, but even that was kishi's work too bc the editor only wanted a rival character and kishi made sasuke. This comment is biased as hell. \n\n\nEverything else in your comment is personal criticism  that you have a problem with not everyone. Side characters are good imo and the world building didn't take from any character, in fact just like you said world building in sci-fi is mostly good if it was character based and that's exactly what kishi is doing. Every concept and piece of the lore got introduced along with a character and all these characters have their own problems and stories that we learn about every chapter. \n\n\nIn naruto chapter 20 team7 haven't even fought zabuza on the bridge yet, so slow down and let the manga breath.\n\n\nEdit: lol getting downvoted for what? Everything i said is true, but apparently this whole subreddit is biased. Should have seen that coming ever since some comments in here criticized this manga for being fast based and some criticized it for being slow based. It's like you people have no idea on what you want this manga be or you simply look for things to hate but it's making you look like complete hypocrites."]

Alright. \n\n>Personally, the main thing that pisses me off it is that it got a fast track to an english printing, sooner than series like Spy X Family and Act-age that actually deserve your attention. \n\nI\'m sorry but you don\'t decide that. \n\n\nKishi worked for 15 years on naruto and made a name for himself and naruto is a big factor on why manga is as popular as it is so i think he earned a promotion.']
[474, 4, 1, 'I don’t mind if it isn’t another juggernaut, I just wanna know why so many people are hating on it. That’s the main problem. People are expecting it to be a fully developed story that’s 100 chapters in already.']
[474, 5, 1, 'How are you caught up with the manga but call Hachimaru bratty? Did you just ignore the small growth he went through? For instance, he apologized to Ryu once he felt he was getting too personal. Unlike MHA and Demon Slayer, Hachimaru is a protagonist who can be both polite and fun. He’s not a goody two shoes wet blanket like those other two.\n\nYou can’t call the Princess thing a forced love interest, yet think one’s like MHA are fine. Uraraka likes Deku because he tries hard? That’s most of their class. Meanwhile, in S8, we’ve actually seen Hachimaru and Ann hang out and they have legitimate chemistry. Neither is in love with the other yet as well. Their friendship is growing first. \n\nDude... are you new to manga/anime stories? Do you honestly think they won’t elaborate on the main villain’s story? They even said there is more to it than that. Yet you love MHA, whose villain is evil because he just hates the good guys and junk?\n\nAnd your last point is just terrible. They skipped over the unimportant fights with the fodder. The chapter focused on Hachimaru’s fight with that new samurai guy. And it’s pretty obvious he’s important. \n\nWow.. I guess the hate towards the series really is unjustified and due to impatience. People expect it to be like stories that would be on their 100th chapter.']

The strongest among the dragons, murim alliance leader, most of the rest of the notable sect leaders in murim etc. some of the characters that are shown in a light of being particularly strong, probably the twins if separated, \nand water guy when above water. In pure physical terms Dad would be considered a freak even among these people.\n5. Dad probably comes in here with the rest of the dragons in terms of fighting power, people who are considered well respected masters, and the strongest diciples of characters higher in the list. Water guy on land might have trouble against most of these? Don\'t know how to call that one based on what we\'ve seen.\n6. Rest of the diciples, noteworthy teachers at the academy, cool name tough guys around murim, anyone that\'s the boss guy of anything significant, etc. etc.\n\nLots of these are probably off by a tier or so since we really haven\'t had that much fighting between powerful characters to base things on.

Why ymir suddenly broke free? \n\nAnswer- EREN.\n\nThrough out history of aot ,only members of Royal Family could have direct contact with ymir, as they strictly kept the powers of founding Titan within there family and used that power to kept ymir imprisoned in the paths dimension and used her as a slave. Members of the Royal Family from different eras, continued this practice for different reasons. \n\nThe kings who inherited founding Titan before 145th eldian king, did this cause they wanted to maintain there rule over the world. \n\nThe kings who inherited founding Titan after 145th king did this out of there fear. They feared that if founding gets into hand of some one else, he will restart the war and will destroy the "peace", that was established after the 145th king dissolved the eldian empire. \n\nHowever eren is different, eren is the first NON-ROYAL BLOODED person who not only have the powers of the founding Titan, but also managed to make a contact with ymir in the paths dimension, and unlike other holders of the founding Titan, eren actually allows ymir to decide her own fate, and ymir decides to rebel. \n\nWait, Zeke is also there and he is Royal blooded, why ymir is not obeying his orders? \n\nAnswer- yes Zeke is a Royal blood, but he doesn\'t wield the power of the founding Titan, eren does. And ymir is personification of that power. Traditionally, holders of the founding Titan were from Royal Family, who had there own goals and ideologies which was different than ymir\'s, so ymir had to work accordingly to will of holder of the founding Titan, she had no choice\n\nHowever in this chapter, eren convinced ymir to break free from her prison and rebel against the cruel world. This is really an historical event In the series, as in first time in the history of aot verse, the founding Titan and the guy who holds the power of founding Titan, are on the same page and have same goals and ideologies. This unique situation allowed ymir to fully bond with the holder of founding Titan ( that is eren) and break free from her prison, despite Zeke\'s orders.\n\nForgive me for my long ass comment.']

The same way Zeke just uses Ymir mirrors how his father used him or how the Marleyeans used the Eldians. Even in Paradise Island, the King used the power to isolate his subjects and subjugate his descendants to follow his will.\n\nSo, when Eren, one of the first two since the King to visits the Paths dimension, says to Ymir that he wants her to make a choice or calls her a human being, I can see her being moved to action in his favor, even if it was just manipulation. Plus, seeing as she has watched his entire life, it's fair to say that she knows it's not and this is how he truly feels about her.\n\nIt doesn't help that Zeke is barking commands at her while Eren is saying all of this."]

I was incredibly lucky and bought it for $10 from a girl on eBay who didn\'t realize its value. Volume 6 was a hassle to get. It\'s so expensive to get a decent copy.

My room was clean and it showed my manga nicely. I happened to make a Reddit to look at other people's manga collection and my boyfriend told me I should post a picture of mine. He told me I should use this picture you see here.\n\nOther reasons:\n-My room is a clusterfuck right now.\n-A good 200 volumes are in random piles on my floor.\n-I'm in the middle of creating a library for my spare room upstairs (takes time and money). Won't be ready until January 2020. I haven't even started it yet other than clearing out old stuff. I'm just earning money for it. Keeping the funds $500, no more. Christmas present to myself.\n-Due to my future library, I am not organizing my manga as nicely since they'll all be moved eventually.\n-I'm lazy\n-Sorry... I disappoint😭"]
[692, 12, 1, "That is a LOADED question. For all the years I've been collecting, I've had different favorites. But really, I have series that stand out for different reasons. Different favorites for different phases in my life, different moods. I'll re-read an old favorite with a new perspective. It's hard to narrow down, but I sincerely love all my manga- except Evergreen. Not Evergreen. Got the whole series off eBay for $15. Never read it before. It was so terrible. I'd be willing to get rid of it. Such inconsistent plotline. Gets too dramatic for zero reason at the end. A sloppy mess. I still read it, but it pained me waaaayyyy too much. Even typical cliches do way better."]

It doesn't matter how much I've aged, it has taught me so many lessons and good messages. It's cliche but a great shoujo. \n\nTypically shorter series get re-read a lot. I can get some great satisfaction quickly that way. Binge 4 mangas a day if possible. \n\nI also re-read a lot that really moved me or had good messages- like *xxxHolic*. I recently re-read *Death Note*.\n\nI typically re-read the volume before a new volume is released to refresh my memory as well. Sometimes I pick up on things I didn't the first time around. So yep"]

A portion of my checks go towards my manga. \n✔️Gift cards/birthdays/holiday: This is all because I have shown the world I am a huge weeb. No secret to my friends and family. My extended family thinks I'm a huge bookworm, so I get Barnes&Noble gift cards from them every year. \n✔️If I get a Target gift card, I try to fill in some series with that- since Target sells manga online.\n✔️I am a hardcore eBay searcher for the best deals.\n✔️I go to local used bookstores and find goods for $1. \n✔️Hand-me-downs from my friends' former collections.\n✔️I don't pay rent or a mortgage. Could say I live with my parents but my dad moved out and I essentially own the house.\n✔️I have a temporary housemate upstairs that gives me $400/month for rent (she leaves in January).\n✔️I have no other interests except for the occasional anime figure.\n✔️A lot of my collection was built as a kid. My mom let me buy 1 book a month (maybe 2) and sometimes more on holidays.\n✔️I don't know if this counts but 80% of what I eat is homemade by me. I spend hours looking at best deals in the grocery store and plan out my meals for the week. My grocery bill is usually $50 every week-ish. This is me providing for 2-3 people (housemate included). I love everything to be healthy and include all elements of the food pyramid.\n\n-I was about to say my boyfriend helps out with money, but I forgot I told him to not spend on me because he's finishing his degree.

I also buy series that give me nostalgia (maybe I read them online long ago and they finally have an English license). I hold off on buying super popular manga usually because I know they'll always be in stock and easy to find.

Two month timeskip. Searching for magic temple? Six month timeskip. Wanna jump straight to the finale? Another year timeskip. \n\nIt\'s kind of annoying that the only sympathetic demons that don\'t exist in flashbacks are Sonju and Musica, yet we\'re supposed to identify with Emma and her boundless compassion for them. I was really hoping we\'d get a more demon-centric narrative when Emma&co were roaming around the demon world, maybe explore the revelation that in the demon world magic (or at least magic water??) is fucking real?!\n\nThe fascinating hints of the world we could see from within the orphanage were one of the most fascinating parts of TPN for me, so seeing it all brushed over in favor of the shounen-tier "we must save errybodyyyyy" was beyond disappointing.']

It was only after Hinata saved him, and he met his father he was able to actually respond. \n\nAnd the whole time, through all of Pain\'s backstory and it\'s ties to Jiraya and to his own struggle, you knew he wanted exactly what Naruto was looking for, all he needed was to believe that Naruto could find it.\n\nI dunno, I felt a lot more then than here - and I really like all these characters (albeit Emma less since the more recent arcs have removed all edges from her character).']

At this point, she didn't so much as stop Norman as offer him an out before the point of no return.

[735, 7, 1, 'Because Emma\'s "victory" over Norman wasn\'t earned. Norman was the cool, calm, collected genius that knew exactly what path he needed to take to bring humanity to victory. For him, the end justified the means. Emma, on the other hand, is an idealist that seeks a perfect solution for every party involved. \n\nNow it\'s not impossible that someone like Emma could change the mind of someone like Norman. However, the setup wasn\'t there. Emma\'s entire argument worked because of something introduced in this chapter alone--Norman\'s inner doubts and fears. Had we always known (or had hints) that Norman is just putting up a front of a cold-blooded leader while being deeply unsure of his actions, the outcome of this chapter would\'ve been a bit more believable. But this way, it seems like Emma just won a massive moral argument out of nowhere.\n\nTo make matters worse, Emma\'s solution of letting humans and demons coexist always struck me as flawed. The author tried to justify it by adding Musica and a new promise and hinting that a peaceful future is possible. But he\'s also skipped way too many steps to justify why anyone in their right mind would consider saving demons to begin with. \n\nBasically, the series is rushed. The characters and plot points aren\'t developed enough for them to be believable, which leads to situations like this one.']
[735, 7, 2, "Because he went from basically being smug in his victory to crying about how he doesn't truly want this.

Hinata was just heading out of the hospital back to their hotel in that scene, so we\'ll get him reuniting with Karasuno and maybe get another crying scene. Maybe he\'ll meet Kenma too to give him back his tablet and exchange several words. Bokuto, Akaashi, and Hoshiumi\'s arcs haven\'t ended either so they\'ve got to at least show a match of those two teams before moving on from nationals.\n\nThere\'s also the "newcomers" tournament in Miyagi where Asahi got blocked by Dateko? So I think we\'ll see the new team play in that one before the 2nd year. Furudate is so unpredictable though so I bet I\'ll be completely wrong.']

[736, 35, 1, "Seems like Tokonami's Ikejiri to me. Daichi's friend from middle school."]
[736, 36, 1, 'When I saw Itachiyama lost, I definitely thought “AFNO’s not gonna like this”, but the more I’ve thought about it, I really like this twist of a decision from Furudate. As the other reply said, it’s thematically-fitting. It’s not about pushing up Bokuto and Fukurodani, it’s about reinforcing/emphasizing the fact that every team and every player experiences loss at some point. One victory does not guarantee another victory. Injuries impact even the greatest of teams (Just as Karasuno losing Hinata hurt them greatly, Itachiyama losing their setter/captain hurt them greatly). MS didn’t show it, but the full score of the game was Inbushi 22-25, 25-20, 29-27 Itachiyama. I’m assuming it was the second set that Itachiyama’s captain got injured. \n\nI was also on the train of “Itachiyama are the absolute kings of the nation”. I liked the idea of them being unbeatable, especially when they beat Inarizaki 3-1 in the IH finals and Fukurodani 2-1 in the Tokyo prelims. But, I respect and have come to love Furudate’s decision to not go with that. Itachiyama isn’t a team of volleyball gods or perfect machines. They’re high schoolers too, and even the strongest teams can, and do, lose earlier than expected. For Itachiyama, this is a cruel way of walking the line between realism and narrative. Upsets happen in real lie, especially when injuries occur. Inubushi can’t be a weak team either, only losing the first set 22-25. No team in the quarterfinals of nationals is weak. \n\nSo yeah, I get why you’re salty, and when you’re Itachiyama’s number one fan without seeing how they play or anything, I totally get it. But, this is all to emphasize the concept of the defeated, something everyone experiences. So Itachiyama won’t be champions this Spring High. But, they’re going to continue to be the favorites next year, I’m sure of that. Maybe we’ll see an Itachiyama that’s seeking revenge and more motivated to win it all, possibly even making them a bigger threat than this year. \n\nIs a small part of this to have Fukurodani win nationals without having them play Itachiyama? Sure, I think so. Furudate likes to keep their teams a mystery until they play Karasuno, so we’ll have to wait for the Year 2 match to see them play, I guess.  But that isn’t the main focus at all over this loss. I understand why you’re annoyed, but I think this choice, which no one could have expected, is clever, fits the series well, and will be the smarter choice in the long run.']
[736, 36, 2, 'I\'m in absolute agreement with your comments from previous chapters advocating for an Itachiyama win over a Fukurodani win, including the lack of story potential and seemingly hollow fanservice should Fukurodani win. And honestly I still think your comments regarding the narrative questionability of a Fukurodani win still hold well, but now this turn of events now makes me entirely content with a Fukurodani win (though at this point I don\'t mind who wins, I\'m more excited to see Karasuno\'s 2nd year)\n\nAs for fanservice, I share your sentiment that Itachiyama\'s loss could be in part due to fans\' endearment of Bokuto as a secondary protagonist, however, personally, I view Itachiyama\'s loss far more as an element of realism--that upsets are a natural and exciting element of sports. I definitely find it somewhat bitter that Itachiyama has been touted as the odds-on favourites and powerhouse, yet we don\'t even see them play once. But, again, I view it more as an element of Haikyuu grounded in real-life sports realism more than fanservice. The fact that they\'ve been hyped up so much could serve to accentuate the shock that they would go out so suddenly. As has been a somewhat important and emphasised in the series, "there\'s no match you can\'t win, and there\'s no match you can win for sure"...or something like that at least. \n\nSo yeah, I shared your predictions 100%, but I\'m pretty satisfied with this twist. It also opens up a whole range of possibilities: \n- Furudate going through with Fukurodani being set up as the secondary protagonists and winning Nationals\n- Kamomedai potentially winning it all to further add to the dynamic of Karasuno\'s revenge next year\n- do we see more of this upset team that beat the odds-on favourites, or is it more of a one-time event (which happens pretty often in sports)']
[736, 36, 3, "I think Hoshiumi got a great backstory. As a fellow short person I've never really connected with Hinata's story honestly, and I find Hoshiumi's story to be much more endearing. He easily ended up being one of my favorite characters, and I think we'll learn more about him too the next time Karasuno faces them (the same way we didn't learn everything about Oikawa the first match). \n\nI also hope Fukurodani wins and hope Kamomedai does. Hoshiumi deserves it, but I think Fukurodani will win. Outcomes of matches are rarely surprising, and Itachiyama is the first instance where I'm genuinely shocked. I'm fine with them losing because it's realistic, and I expect Fukurodani winning is to set up the narrative of every team in Nationals next year competing to make up for the previous year.\n\nAnother reason I think Itachiyama lost is to keep Sakusa a bit more secret until Karasuno faces them. I was wondering how they could possibly have a Fukurodani vs Itachiyama match and not show it, and I guess this chapter kinda answered that lol. Last chapter I was excited to see the rest of Nationals but now I'm honestly fine with just getting a note about the outcome, whatever."]
[736, 36, 4, "I share your sentiment regarding Hoshiumi and Hirugami. For me, Hirugami is the character that held my attention throughout the match even though Hoshiumi is suppose to be the star. I'm kind of surprised how indifferent I am to Hoshiumi as a character and it's mostly because he's just that simple. Almost all of his actions and behavior eventually boil down to his short height and how he needs to prove himself because of it. It's a valid motivation but at the same time, I would like to see more depth from him. The only moment where I felt some interest in Hoshiumi is his evolving dynamic with Hinata. It was refreshing for me to see him recognizing someone else's strength and be personally invested in the rivalry. Hopefully Hoshiumi gets more fleshed out, but at the moment, he's kind of a flat character for me. Sorry not sorry."]
[736, 36, 5, "After I saw the Itachiyama loss, I definitely thought of how you'll be reacting haha\n\nKinda shocking (I was also very hyped to see more of Sakusa and Komori and was expecting them to maybe at least play Fukurodani again), but I'm not pissed about it or anything. It's interesting narrative-wise. If Haikyuu does end up going on for a while there is an advantage to keeping most of what they're like hidden for now"]
[736, 36, 6, '>But by having the 2nd fan favorite team win Nationals he somewhat would keep the fans satisfied. This is all I could think of as the reason why Furudate did it. \n\nThe fact that you think Furudate would do things for "fanservice" genuinely makes me laugh. Have they EVER done things for FANSERVICE??? Have you read the entire series? What was done to Itachiyama was clever and thematically-fitting. It would\'ve been super repetitive if Itachiyama beat Fukurodani and Kamomedai to win the championship.\n\nAlso, Fukurodani is not the 2nd fan-favourite team. It\'s Nekoma.']
[736, 38, 1, 'Kageyama will only be a second year next year so too early for him to become a captain. The flashbacks during the Wakutani match showed that Ennoshita will likely become the captain next year.']
[736, 40, 1, "Ennoshita was set up as the next captain since Libero's can't. Also, Bokuto is a third year, so this is his last tournament."]

[736, 41, 1, '😂 He has been there since right before vs Kamomedai match started. Ch338 to be specific, lol.']
[736, 43, 1, 'In terms of your first point, I don’t think they’ll keep pulling the injury/exhaustion card, especially as Hinata moves from first-year rookie to a second year who is experienced in these types of environments. He won’t be so absorbed in being at such a grand event that he would neglect his health. If you noticed, the second and third years never had moments of exhaustion to the point where it affected their ability to play (it’s even pointed out in one of the earlier matches if I remember correctly). Meanwhile, Tsukishima, Kageyama, and Hinata have all had moments where their stamina failed them, so I think moving forward it’ll happen less often as they become more experienced. \n\nAs for the second point, that is definitely much more of a mystery as we really haven’t had anything. If I had to predict anything, I would predict that because Karasuno’s reputation had fallen prior to the start of the series, there were no real “high-caliber” prospects thinking of Karasuno and hence they weren’t shown.

He\'s the perfect foil to Hinata - who struggled so much to overcome his height and win and play the volleyball he wants to, only to meet this random guy who had already achieved all of these things. Hoshiumi\'s philosophy is that he doesn\'t "find other ways" to "make up for his height" or use other weapons. He doesnt say "I can\'t do this because I\'m short so I\'ll do other things to my advantage instead", he says "I can do this even though I\'m short because I\'ll practice so hard that my height doesn\'t even matter anymore".\n\nWe haven\'t seen Hoshiumis whole arc through - I\'m sure he\'ll get knocked down a peg or something in his next two matches with the unknown teams or Fukurodani.']

I personally don\'t mind the concept of the Evil Adolf Hitler of the food world but I thought it\'d be cooler if we could go down the training arc path or see a couple more arcs where we see Soma really focus on improving himself. Or if we\'re talking about him going straight for the first seat that\'s cool too, but I find it kinda wack that he\'s gonna try and get it after the whole "1st seat turns heel and sides with food hitler" by fighting in this huge group fight with everybody else. It would have been cool to see him go at it 1v1 after training hard to become a better version of himself, or some other creative writing which involved him versing multiple seats to get to the first seat where we see each of the seat\'s specialized skills, or whatever. I\'m just not too crazy about the way they did all this world building and now it\'s like they\'re cramming all of the characters and possible arcs they\'ve set up into this 1 final arc which becomes good vs bad rather than soma becoming a better chef.

Soma acknowledges that Erina is the special person that he wants to cook for but that\'s basically it. They don\'t express these feelings to each other, just in their own internal monologues.!<\n\n>!With a different protagonist Megumi would have had a better chance but Soma has always been about challenge, competing, and pushing his cooking further. Someone that could actually be a rival (rather than just follow behind and supporting him) would be more appealing to Soma, who was never really that interested in romance to begin with.

When I was adopted in 1998, my one sister moved down in the basement briefly.

[847, 1, 1, "You made a very important point, but in general with a few storylines being reprinted and collected in volumes or omnibuses, it's fairly manageable to start since the beginning of a comic book. The whole multi-verse and alternate timelines is certainly a headache, but from my understanding certain storylines are worthwhile, while others aren't and you can skip them. I feel that comic book publishers are unwilling to try new things and only focus on rebooting: which I think is what is causing creative stagnation. That, and their unwillingness to try anything new.\n\nIn regards to your second paragraph; the fact that in manga you have to first provide a one-shot, and then approval from readership reception, I believe it is much easier for aspiring creators to have their work published. This way, new stories and characters can be involved in the comic book universe of the respective publishing company. I don't know how it is for comic books, but it seems that it is harder for a new creator to have their work published-at least for big publishing companies.\n\nI just feel that the publishing system of comic books keeps prospective creators away, mainly because the burden will fall on the company than on the creator. But I think that this would not be the case if comic book publishers adopted the manga publishing system. What about a new independent comic book publisher that operates under the manga model, do you think it might work?"]
[847, 2, 1, 'For your first paragraph: my concern is that there is no new input in general. It\'s always reboots of the same characters for the big publishing companies, those big companies are also interested and known only (mostly) for one genre, superheroes, and rarely endeavor into other genres. They also seem to be averse to risk-taking or trying new things. Maybe it\'s not that readership wants the same thing, but that they don\'t want changes to already established characters or storylines: readers want different things but with different and new characters. Unfortunately, because many of the characters belong not to creators but to companies, a creators\' work is limited and therefore only work on what is "safe". If the creator, and not the publisher, is at fault for a failed work, then maybe the publishers would be more open to new creators or concepts.\n\nThink about manga publishers, they focus on demographics not genre: yes, it has many "safe" works and concepts under similar guidelines to comic books, but they publish many genres all under a targeted demographic. The genre can range from action, mystery, drama, romance, etc. What ultimately matters is popularity and readership, some may like one genre over the other, or equally like two different genres. It\'s a very flexible system, and because of that flexibility publishers are willing to take risks or support works that they didn\'t think would succeed. This is what is very different from comic book publishers.  \n\n\nIn regards to your second paragraph: while it\'s true that manga executives and editors do have a say on what gets or isn\'t published, they certainly would be reluctant to cancel a cash-cow series. In doing so they may alienate the fans and lose readership, and money in the process. Also, from my understanding, manga editors work together with creators as advisers rather than deciding the direction of the creators\'work. Comic book editors exist to ensure all the creators are in line with what the company wants, manga editors work to ensure the creators\' work is consistent and to coach them. It just seems that the manga system is much more considerate of the authors\' creative freedom and choice than under the comic book system.']

Since that's not what happened, my interest is pretty much gone.\n\nAlthough, I s'pose if this has done anything positive for me, it has changed how I look at Isekai Meikyuu and Seichou Cheat. I mean, even though both MCs are degenerates that went out of their way and acquired slaves for the purposes of sex, which isn't especially wholesome or inspiring; but at least they genuinely care for them despite how things started, heck they're both literally in love with them even though Seichou Cheat's MC is the only one to admit it openly so far.\n\nTough choice there, books where MCs did a skeevy thing and then ended up with a companion they utterly adore and fawn over, or a book with an FMC that goes nuts and rapes a dude that she's only known for like... five minutes. I dunno, maybe I am the weird one here, but raping people doesn't seem like it would give them the best impression of you. Although, the fact that Taishi has basically given himself to her probably explains how he became a total fucking degenerate himself.\n\nBetween this and the E Rank Healer, I've suddenly got a whole bunch of characters I utterly loath. It's kind of surprising. FMC and Inn girl need to die in a fire."]

[934, 1, 2, "> Crazy how all the guys have such top tier Fiancees only to look at that flatchested brat instead.\n\nIt's understandable when you look at their personalities.\n\nAs Margaret points out, relationships between fiances tend to be frosty. Nobles know that their future partner has been decided and see it as a transactional arrangement. They don't expect love or affection from it. So if a girl treats them nicely and gives them a compliment, it's as if they had seen an unicorn.\n\nThis chapter is a good example: Martina is an exception in the sense that she does show lots of love for Sykes, but her love is one-sided and violent. She doesn't want to hear any criticism and we're told her beatings of Sykes are a regular occurrence. Is it any wonder he'd have eyes for Margaret instead?"]

I think she is the only one that show some kind of evolution in the serie (with Sykes, but hm...), even in the LN.\n\nEdit: as a side note, this whole serie (the LN) has a "french comédie" à la Molière vibe: stupid situations, plot that barely makes sense, stupid character used as comic relief, sexual joke, evil character being mostly comically evil, tropes, that one character that you can kind of sympathize with, deus ex machina at the end.']
[934, 6, 2, '> Is it bad that, of all the characters, my favorite one is **Margaret**?\n\nNot really. Although I found Rachel\'s shenanigans more hilarious, Margaret is one of those characters that fall squarely into the "you\'re not wrong, but sometimes you\'re really an asshole about it" category.\n\nMargaret\'s enjoyable because she plays a standard antagonistic role we\'ve all seen a thousand time in otome games and fiction based on their setups, but she does it for understandable and not particularly malicious reasons, and seems to be an actually fairly nice person. I mean, by this point, when I see a WN/manga of the \'otome villainess\' style starting with a prince jilting his fiance in favor of a relatively lower-class girl (or when that potential\'s brought up as a plot point), I expect that girl to be worthy of every insult Marina was throwing at Margaret.\n\nI also like that she\'s not particularly smart, but she\'s not a total airhead either. Hell, she discovered a new theological concept on her own: "god likes big tits". Margaret\'s way closer to an actual reverse harem or otome game protagonist than usual for her sort of character in this type of story, but without a lot of the idealism and general helplessness/cluelessness that those usually have.\n\n>She isn\'t wrong either that relationships between fiances aren\'t precisely very good, yet they complain when their partners have eyes for prospects that treat them with some degree of niceness.\n\nThis line got me cackling with laughter, because it is *so* damning to a horde of stories/characters. I can\'t count the number of times I\'ve seen a tsundere get jealous that their desired partner is getting along with some other girl, when the answer of "maybe if you actually displayed any affection and perhaps stopped beating him up at the drop of a hat, he\'d be more interested in you than in her" is staring them in the face.\n\n>going after another person\'s fiance is a jerkass move\n\nTBH, given the way Rachel and the prince treated each other, I don\'t think it actually was a jerkass move on Margaret\'s part. Trying to commit netori on a love match is far different in my eyes than breaking up an arranged marriage that neither party is happy with.']

[942, 5, 1, "No it's not a dumb question, actually it really common. the original anime only covers the manga to about chapter 14/ episode 17 when Rin fights Amaimon. Then the anime studio goes on its own separate plot line. Mostly because their wasn't many chapters at the time and this manga updates monthly so it's slow. \n\nLater in 2016 the anime studio did a similar thing to Full mental alchemist brotherhood where the did a soft reboot and started where the anime left of. They adapted the Kyoto saga which goes up to chapter 34. \n\nThe original anime and the manga plots are very different except some key elements  and usually the details are different. For example right now Rin's been learning about blue night and his parents for the past couple of chapters. Yuri and Satan's relationship is very different in the manga. \n\nAnime: Yuri is a daughter of a high ranking priest and fell in love with Satan the wise and old king of demons and they want demons and humans together live in peace.  The have the twins in the woods in secret. \n\nManga: Yuri is a homeless orphan who gets pick up by the exorcist cause she can see demons. For a unknown reason she has a deep connection with the blue flame sprits called Rinka. At the time Satan wasn't considered a demon more like natural phenomenon that would sometimes appear alongside demons. But spending time with Yuri awakened him and he became sentient. He's a very young demon and sort of like a feral manchild. Yuri runs away with satan because she knows that without her he'll go berserk and kill everyone. They get get captured and Yuri dies giving birth in a failed exorcism of the twins.\n\nAnyway overall I'd say if you watched the original anime you only got the first arc and a bunch of non cannon filler. While if you watch season 2 your about 4-5 arcs behind. Honestly I'd read the manga it's story is way better and only God knows if the anime will ever adapt the whole thing."]
