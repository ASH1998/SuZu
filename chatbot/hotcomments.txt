It is possible that Miku had a similar incident the next day though, so she\'s not ruled out yet. I guess it\'s also possible that she goes to the hospital now and spends the whole next day there, but I really doubt that her sisters would wait that long to tell Ichika. \n\nNow that we\'ve seen the set up, take your bets on how Miku is going to kiss Fuutarou next week. I think that she will somehow still get the boys and girls to reconcile on day 2 despite the fire, maybe they both work together at the pancake stall as a loophole.

Nakaba seems to really want to close off the character arcs of Escanor and Diane, but having it during an event with little stakes isn't the best way to present them.\n\nHere, Escanor looks like a pathetic oaf. Reminded me of the time when Makarov (Fairytail) killed himself for no reason even though he knew there was another way. It's less farfetched than Fairytail, but it's still kinda bad. And Diane, even at the end of it all still ended up feeling like a character that was just.....around. \n\nI would've preferred if Mael refused to give Escanor Sunshine, and Escanor just ends up joining the battle anyway and putting himself and the Sins in danger trying to protect him because he didn't want to let go of his uselessness. You know, make Escanor learn that it's okay to be weak if it's the only way you can be."]

Many chapters later, I feel that he really hasn\'t.\n\nObviously the true villain of this manga is the author. His primary goal (other than writing what he wants and continuing to succeed in selling volumes and I of course wish him well in that regard) is absolutely to write a girl so pitiable and anxious that every reader with a heart will end every chapter with dread and dispair for her. This feeling will turn into anxiety and hope at the sight of a new chapter as we think of how Ruko is finally going to be released from her prison life.\n\nMaybe this chapter is the one where things will finally start to get better for this girl. She\'s done nothing but be kind to her friends, family, and strangers and she desperately needs someone to be kind to her. Someone will come by and punch a spirit away right as she\'s mortified again to be living in her hellscape. He it she will know Ruko can see them and immediately explain to her that they\'ve been fighting them for years and had never met anyone who could see them before. They understand her when she tells them that they were too scared to ask anyone for help out of fear of what would happen to her if any spirit ever found out. She cries. This time, the tears aren\'t misery, but relief. She finally gets her hug and for the first time in many years she\'s alive to sleep peacefully. She\'s given a phone number by her savior that she can use whenever she needs help or just someone to talk to, which begins a whole new storyline of romance and fighting against the monsters she had feared all her life as she learns more and more about why she can see them.\n\nThen the chapter ends and we\'re reminded that this manga isn\'t one of those stories. Ruko is left crying and shaking alone and unchanged again. Just another chapter in her torturous existence.']

Lemme restate this for emphasis. *The main plot of the story felt shoehorned into the story*.\n\nLike my best example of this is when the friend of the MC committed suicide. When it happened, it felt like it happened because of the years of abuse from her brother, compounded by the fact that her love for the MC will never be requited. That shit *stung* to read (in a good way). And then every chapter after that basically screamed "THE CULT MADE HER DO IT" even though it felt totally unrelated when it happened. Or when the Idol got outed for her activities and ostracized despite being the victim. That shit also stung (in a good way). And then she went to the scientist to become an esper which just sorta, happens I guess. It makes sense sure, but I honestly do not care. All the parts of the manga I do like are unrelated to the actual main plot is the important thing to take away here.\n\nThere\'s parts of the manga that I think can be / are good, but they\'re honestly suffering under a main plot that feels janky and unnecessary. The worst part is I think this kind of story could work, even with the cult and everything. But I honestly don\'t think the author is up to the task, and I myself don\'t really know what exactly it needs to really bring it to life. There\'s something worth salvaging in there, but I have my doubts it\'ll be found.']

I found myself asking "what the fuck is going on?" pretty much every time they got into a conflict.\n\nI think the author should have either made it more grounded or went hard in the more abstract direction ala *Pun Pun*.

Many mental illnesses are well treated, with and without medication, by trained professionals and just winging it can lead to very bad things happening to everyone involved. \n\nI know it's just a manga but I just want to make sure people don't see this and think, yeah if I give someone a room and talk to them we can solve the issue, 100% not the case. I still fear that therapist and psychologist are demonized by people and media when in fact they can be extremely helpful and effect."]

They may become perfect reflections of the destructive behavior of their parents, or rendered dysfunctional at worst.\n\nThere are people that seem to think that they don't deserve love and affection, and overlook that these are individuals who are **raised**, are susceptible to kindness and are in the capacity of reciprocating it as a result.\n\nAs a general rule, one may raise good children if one is good, regardless of mental disabilities/illnesses."]

Similarly they have issues with general conduct and pleasantries but not because they cannot do it but because they don't notice it and don't really care about it. The bluntest conversations suffice and in Japan with its polite conduct must even be worse for her than a Western Nation would be.\n\nThat doesn't mean that they cannot learn conduct and at least care for basic pleasantries if they are taught to do so. Of course this works better the earlier they are caught and diagnosed. Megumi however seems to be entirely untreated and even the normal coping mechanism of female Aspergers, basically copying popular girls around them to blend in, seems to have either not occured or failed massively along the way."]

[182, 2, 'Not related to Sato but Ajin in general, but one of my favourite aspects is how it manages to incorporate elements of video games way better and in a more meaningful way than any other story that includes gamey aspects. And I don\'t mean the very obvious "it\'s like a video game" stuff that Sato says.\n\nThe manga introduces a set of rules and then pushes those rules to their absolute limit by having the characters come up with the most ridiculously genius ways of using them, which is very reminiscent of the mechanics abuse and creative problem solving you see in games. It goes out of its way to set up situations and very detailed plans that all play into the established systems and puts a ton of focus on them.\n\nWhile there are other stories that have that much thought put into them, what gives Ajin that final nudge that puts it into video game territory are all of the other, more apparent aspects. Sato\'s love for games, the aforementioned gamey nature of his behaviour, the military porn that gives it a modern FPS feeling and the obvious fact that Ajin basically respawn all serve to recontextualise the characters\' abuse of their powers into something a lot more akin to a video game than most other stories that include their elements.\n\nIt doesn\'t achieve that by implementing straightforward video game mechanics (you know exactly what type manga I\'m talking about), but by weaving both superficial and more abstract aspects of the medium into the very core of the story\'s flow.\n\nThe creator is obviously very much into video games, especially seen by how he named almost every chapter in a certain story arc after various games. It\'s honestly great to see him channel the love he has for them into a story that can still stand on its own legs and doesn\'t feel like it\'s overtly relying on their elements.']

They usually tend to have very unique styles, but they are generally known to have beautiful art-styles, and many of the authors have the magical look that Irie Aki has.\n\nFor example, I think Kouji Miyata had a style of drawing surreal moments similar to Irie Aki, although it's much bolder in his works. \n\nIn terms of details, I think Kaoru Mori, Sassa Taiga and Kasai Sui are pretty good. They are more realistic than surrealistic though.\n\nYou could also check out Hakumei to Mikochi, another manga being published in Harta."]

I wonder if that's on purpose?\n\nExcited to see what the other team think of this performance, it's very much a double edged sword.\n\nMaybe theyll do a completely different take on the princess?? Yonagi's performance makes you terrified of the princess' rage, I wonder if chiyoko's version will come across more sympathetic, allowing the audience to understand her rage and root for her, instead of being targeted by tge rage like yonagi's?"]

[266, 7, "I need to know more about the author of this manga. It's an example of the medium at its best: original, exciting, captivating. Reading it is a joy."]
[266, 8, 'Dirty tactics aside (the variety of which I\'m not happy about), Yonagi\'s performance at the moment is convincing. Like, from us reader\'s perspective, this isn\'t a case of "the characters talking about how good the actor is doing", and is instead a "the artwork speaks for itself" case, far more convincing for us in the real world. Full marks to Shiro Usazaki the artist.\n\nSince this Princess Iron Fan was originally Hanako\'s work in the first place, one could argue that she\'s doing her best bringing her work to life and giving it a faithful adaptation, but I concur that putting Yonagi and the audience\'s mood on a knife\'s edge is a bad idea.\n\nIt\'s definitely possible for Chiyoko to give a "ethereal divine" performance as opposed to Yonagi\'s "dominating divine" one, and would be entertaining to see. Though as much as I wouldn\'t mind Kuroyama, Chiyoko and Arata winning by giving a more ethereal show, again the question of faithfulness to the work comes about: is the "better" production/adaptation the one that\'s more faithful to the original work, or the one that brings better delight to the audience, even if it might run contrary to the intent of the author herself?\n\nBut what\'s "better" is going to be an academic topic in itself, which isn\'t so relevant for this contest. Like or dislike, the sweet and sourness of the respective works to the audience\'s mental palate will be all that matters this time around.\n\n\\---\n\nSomething else I want to discuss: it was only a fleeting thought last chapter, but now I\'m really feeling this - Yonagi is going to face the same predicament that Skip Beat\'s Kyoko had to contend with at one point.  \nOh, I have no doubt that Yonagi will come back from this deep dive into her rage (though it may take some time), but rather for what comes afterwards has me curious: **typecasting**.\n\nWe know about the range at which Yonagi can act, but people who aren\'t close to her won\'t\n\n* Not only was the Night of the Galactic Express play not seen by as many people, but here Yonagi was playing a male role. Cross-dressing performance aside, the audience here had no way to assess what kind of female "character" she be. Cute, beautiful or cool? Good or evil, hero or villain, law or chaos?\n* As for Death Island, being undoubtedly overshadowed by Iron Fan aside, the significance of Yonagi\'s role is limited, and is overshadowed by Chiyoko\n\nFor many, this will be the public\'s first impression of seeing the Shinjuku Girl in an acting capacity, so terrifying them all like this is going to be a heavy double-edged sword. They will be impressed with Yonagi alright, but at the same time they\'ll all default her to be a "villain" character. (Kyoko\'s first wide impression was also that of a terrifying antagonist role)\n\nWhich is extra bad, since it\'ll be unhealthy for Yonagi (way moreso than with Kyoko), and it\'ll be bad for Kuroyama for what he eventually wants her for. But will be interesting to see how the mangaka duo will handle this topic.']
[266, 9, "I'm conflicted with how Hanako uses Yonagi. Yeah she's great as Princess Iron Fan now, but who'll like her after this?"]
[266, 10, '>"You are an awful human"\n\n>Hanako: "ok"\n\nYo, what Hanako is doing is legit not ok. I understand this is all in the service of maximizing the performance of Kei in this play, but what went down in the last 3 chapters is legitimately in the realm of emotional abuse. When they showed that Hanako put her painting in front of Kei to further increase her rage and she went "Good, she\'s continuing with the play" I was in disbelieve as to how far she\'s going with all of this. She made Kei into the villain, and I don\'t know if she can recover from it anytime soon.\n\nI would guess that the fallout from this wont redeem Hanako (I very much doubt there is anything that could redeem her at this stage IMO) but rather reveal that deep down, she thinks that once the play is over, Kei is going to punish her (either through insults, or physical harm) because Hanako feels she deserves it for what she had done (and also to give Kei closer for what went down with her dad).\n\nI guess at this stage, Chiyoko is going to be the one who needs to win in order to both save Kei, and also spare Hanako. My guess at this stage would be that Chiyoko and Araya aren\'t only going to give a better and more dynamic performance, but that is also entertaining (in contrast to Kei\'s and Riku\'s, which while amazing, is pretty hard to enjoy). In the middle of it, Kei will come to also realize that the source of the rage she felt was a deep love that had been betrayed (which I guess might also tie into Chiyoko or Araya realizing their feelings for Yonagi as well, for bonus points).\n\nStill, I would be pissed off unless Kei punches Hanako once in the face for what she\'s doing now.']

Also, there's pretty much no bullshit misunderstanding based drama, every problem that comes up feels understandable.\n\nAfter the last time I reread I confirmed it that it is very much my favourite manga ever, and I try to recommend it every chance I get."]

[431, 5, "Well, it's not a Manga, but maybe you'll like Kubera: One Last God. It's a Korean Webtoon that has been going on for more than 9 years. It comes under fantasy, mystery, tragedy, drama, adventure, action, romance, comedy, etc. So you may like it.\n\nIt's has an absolutely amazing story and plot structure, as well as very well developed characters and extremely well thought out world building. Be warned though, it will take a lot of patience to appreciate. Foreshadowing is very important in this comic and seemingly trivial details will become extremely important and vital to the story later on. \n\nIt does take a while to pick up steam, as most of the first season is mainly world building and basic setting, in fact, early readers maybe frustrated by how seemingly very little happens in the first season. However, even the most trivial of details in the first season will become very important in the 2nd and 3rd Seasons. The second season will really give you a very different impression of the story than which was given at the beginning. It gets incredibly good in the 3rd season. The world the author Currygom creates is complex and the main characters are well-developed.\n\nBut there are a lot of hidden hints about the story and it's future that are so well camouflaged in the first season that you wouldn't realize that they were hints until you read the second season. The story is a mystery and although we have a basic idea of what's going on, there's still a lot of stuff that we don't know, a lot of mysteries haven't been resolved. Also, for each question answered and each mystery resolved, many more questions and mysteries pop up, which makes the story very exciting. It's one of those stories that have only gotten better with time and chapters and it's gotten better with each rereading.\n\nForgive the art in the first season though, it improves greatly in the second season and I guess a lot of improvement had happened even by the end of the first season. Also, pace has been sacrificed for depth.It really requires a lot of patience to appreciate, which many average readers don't have. It's excellent for those who tend to over think things and like to create theories and attempt to predict what's going to happen."]

But it\'s another one where there\'s markedly bad favoritism for one sibling, a generally messed up family situation that neither of the kids really knew how to deal with. One "defended" by the mother for love, the other "favoured" by the father, though for \'inheritance\' instead.\n\nJust this time, the talent ball landed on the one that was relegated to the backgrounds (yoriichi), who instead of lashing out about it or being upset at the treatment, bore it with dignity and strength beyond what anyone expected. The other unable to watch with how uncomfortable they were with the entire situation, took on attributes of false pride of their \'father\' and put down the loved child ( internally this time through pity), and tried to fulfill the perceived requirements for love and acceptance as inundated by the father ( Master Swordsmanship, powers and duty, head of house, name and honor as \'first son\')\n\nBut it\'s all for naught, Yoriichi had more strength, love, and maturity than any michikatsu could reach for as a child. The false acknowledgement  didn\'t fuel his ego, it instead feuled his feelings of inadequacy, regret, anger, and frustration. He gave up on being attached to his mom because he thought yoriichi must have needed it more, and because it was expected of the first born to be independent and better.\n\n But in doing so, he never really knew her and wasn\'t looped in on what was going on at all. For all the material goods he was given, all the instructing, all that expected of him by their father and he bought into, he was never acknowledged the right way that would have mattered.\n\nHe\'s if Zuko never had Iroh or Ursa, and grew up full of suppressed uncertainties and neglect like Azula was. But his personality meant that he funnelled it all into a life long complex of unrealistic expectations and inadequacy. Where only in gaining his abilities with the mark and swordsmanship, did it feel like he had any self worth, (because that at least wasn\'t falsely given to him, that he earned).\n\n So sunbro\'s nonchallannce with his own powers, strength, and abilities, always felt like an invalidation of everything he put his efforts into. Another reason that he\'s never enough. It\'s not true though, but he could never see that. He wasn\'t properly acknowledged the way he needed when it mattered, and by the time he grew up and grew old, it was too late.']

[474, 2, 'Couple of reasons so far:\n\n* The thing about sci-fi is that while worldbuilding is important, most of the good ones are character-based. For the first part of the story, it felt like Kishi was too concerned about telling us about the Samurai world and all of its intricacies instead of telling us why we should care about the characters. One Japanese reviewer put it in a metaphor, saying it’s like asking someone what the rules of soccer are and instead they talk about the artificial grass. \n* Side characters are meh atm. Ann doesn’t really have anything that makes her appealing besides “oh she’s Hachimaru’s love interest”, and Nanashi was a potential interesting character who had a chapter or two of screentime and then just left. \n* A recent Reddit article highlighted how much of the concepts Naruto had that people liked came from editorial changes. In comparison, the editor for S8 seems to just love Kishimoto and appears to be fairly hands-off as a result.  \n* The art was fairly cluttered early on, and made it difficult to really understand things. \n* It’s getting pushed. A lot. Some Japanese stores are reporting that they can only order more volumes of Demon Slayer and Spy x Family if they purchase a certain number of S8 volumes, and even other Shonen Jump manga volumes include S8 promotional booklets. They even started a fanart contest with Kishi acting as a judge. People generally don’t like when a company pushes them to like a series, especially when they could be advertising more deserving series like Chainsaw Man or any of the new Jump titles instead. \n* While not a direct criticism, the first volume of S8 had a comment from Kishi stating that he thinks manga is like dried squid, so if you don’t like it you just need to chew some more (I.e. buy the second volume). It just has the air of “if you don’t like it, keep buying it I swear it will get better”.']
[474, 3, "It would be an utterly unremarkable series if not for the author.\n\nPersonally, the main thing that pisses me off it is that it got a fast track to an english printing, sooner than series like Spy X Family and Act-age that actually deserve your attention. And with how slow the printing process goes, at this rate we won't see Jujutsu or Chainsaw Man until 2021..."]

[474, 5, 'Samurai 8 does get excessive hate but it\'s somewhat valid. To me, Samurai 8 comes off as unnecessarily convoluted and kind of pretentious. (the setting really isn\'t as complicated or interesting as it\'s being made out to be) The hate most likely stems from Kishimoto being a prolific mangaka. There are very high expectations for him and they\'re not being met for a lot of people. If this story wasn\'t being done by Kishi, it\'d just be ignored instead.\n\nI could also kind of refute many of the points you\'ve brought up. Hachimaru acts bratty when Daruma gives him lectures so he\'s definitely not intelligent or polite. (MHA and KnY protags are miles ahead in that regard) The princess mechanic also urks people (like me) as it feels like a forced love interest. Villain is also a cliche "I want to wipe out life and become god" kind of villain so negative points for that. Don\'t know how you can say it isn\'t about random battles since the last chapter is during a battle royale with a montage against random no-name samurai.']

Seriously, Rokudou is a \\*dream\\*.   \nThere's no power creep.   \nA well rounded cast.  \nA diverse cast of female supporting characters, each with their own motivations and goals.   \nA diverse cast of MALE supporting characters with motivations and goals.  \nDevelopment of ALL the above.  \nStory elements that don't get thrown by the wayside.  \nGreat pacing with lots of action and arcs that ALWAYS create a change in the status quo by their end, interspersed with little breaks too short to be called filler.  \nFemale characters develop relationships with OTHER MALE characters.  \nA sense of progression.  \n\n\nIt's all there, in bloody fisted answer to the harem genre's flaws and many of the SHONEN genre's flaws.\n\n  \nI suppose some characters do feel shallow, and the art, while I love it, is not top of the pops for the industry but it works for the story and I find conveys motion and violence very well.

(There are others I would recommend that are still running, but it sounded like you wanted something that was finished.)\n\n<Oyaji> A father returns to the family he walked out on. Very good, very short, and very manly.\n\n<Akumetsu> A dude takes deadly (and often hilariously ironic) revenge on the corrupt elements of Japanese politics, business, and medicine. Most of the evil he\'s purging is loosely based on historical incidents, and a number of the characters are *very* thinly-veiled caricatures of real politicians.\n\n<Pluto> An android detective tries to figure out who\'s murdering the best androids in the world, and why - while trying to not get murdered himself. He\'s on the list too.\n\n<Biomega> A dude on a motorcycle and a talking bear with a sniper rifle try to save a girl with an immunity to a virus that turns people into zombies from an evil megacorporation who\'d like to experiment on her. Then things get *weird*.\n\n<The Voynich Hotel> A dude on the run from the mob checks into a strange hotel on a stranger island. One of the staff falls in love with him. Assassins come after him. The island and its residents are hiding a FUCKTON of crazy secrets. There\'s no way this could go wrong, right?\n\n<Sun-Ken Rock> You ever have one of those days when you move to a really cheap apartment in Korea to follow the girl you\'ve had a crush on since high school, and accidentally get appointed a group leader in the Korean Mafia? No? Well, that\'s exactly what happens to our protagonist in this manga. It can\'t decide whether it wants to be an oddball comedy, a Tarantino-esque crime flick, or a sort of \'true crime\'-ish thing, but the weird combination ends up working out very well.\n\n<Aku no Kyouten> This one\'s pretty short. A high school teacher not only teaches English classes, but helps his students out with extracurricular problems in their lives. He\'s a great guy - both the students and the administration love him! Then things get really dark. (I don\'t want to spoil how this goes, but I do have to mention that this gets extremely dark after a certain point.)\n\n<Saitama Chainsaw Shoujo> This is *very* short, and is a riotously hilarious time. It\'s about a girl with a yandere streak who\'s inherited the American martial art of chainsaw-wielding, is madly obsessed with a boy at her school, sees him with another girl, ...and you can guess what happens next. (Seriously, this thing is incredibly lighthearted and very funny. It\'s not a Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but it makes the jokes about that and other slasher movies.)\n\n<Bio Meat: Nectar> Humanity has developed a new source of food: a non-conscious creature/thing that just grows and grows and grows meat that they can slice pieces off of endlessly. THEN IT BECOMES A HORROR MOVIE MONSTER. The best part about this one is that it starts out with the main characters as kids, and has a couple of timeskips to them as teenagers and then as adults, which it pulls very well.\n\n<Hotel> (The one by Boichi.)

[576, 3, "Setting aside that Heath obviously had a long-standing crush on Aria driving him to take risks to keep up with her, thinking about this and the previous chapter and what we know about their relationship, the entire situation is a bit disconcerting. Not only have they made a big deal out of a tiny age gap, but considering he and Aria were so close and became adventurers together the idea that she would simply go solo and abandon Heath is baffling.\n\nGranted, it seems to be implied that Heath-- if not their entire group along with him --wasn't progressing as quickly as she was, but what we're shown is her reaching C rank, which would suggest the rest of the party was probably D rank. Again, not exactly a big gap. It feels like we're missing information, though, because it should have been obvious-- regardless of one-sided crushes --given their history, that always being together and even becoming adventurers together it's practically inevitable that the side being left behind will take it hard and feel dejected. Especially given the nature of this book, since no one seems to be capable of actually talking out their problems with each other without a nudge from Grandpa Jin.\n\nI mean, just look at the two from the previous chapters. Even if the one girl's reasons for suddenly adopting an entirely new and different dream, which required her to resume her role as head of the family which she previously quite vocally had no interest in, made fuck all sense with what we knew about her neither of them had the bright idea to actually talk out their issues before Grandpa Jin waddled in rather than yelling them at each other and going crazy.\n\nOf course, I am not saying Aria is necessarily to blame for Heath's death, but it's becoming a common theme of this book for folks to overlook how their actions come off to other people for better and worse and based on what we know currently, I have a feeling Aria was probably too wrapped up in her desire of becoming a capable adventurer like her deceased parents to recognize the feelings of those around her and for Heath in particular how much he'd been working just to stay by her side and how important that was to him, considering it seems pretty evident that he'd only become an adventurer for her sake. Which I think she's probably only partially understood with his death, seeing as she's given up adventuring entirely now.\n\nSure, she isn't really to blame and she was never obliged to reciprocate any of his feelings and stick with him, but being incredulous of how your actions affect others isn't a great way to carry on, especially when you hit those times where there's a real need to hunker down and have heart-to-hearts with the people closest to you. Unfortunately for Jin, since all of this isn't happening in real time there's only so much his sagely advice can offer at this stage."]

Remember when Falco, during the Marley arc, said that titan shifters only regenerate if they have the will to live? Well, if you go back to the Uprising arc and re read the underground chapel scene you will see that Eren really did give up since is wounds didn\'t heal.

[596, 44, 'Dam, imagine spending god knows how many eternities in a wasteland building god knows how many titans and paths one bucket of sand at a time. All alone in a dimension where only a select few can enter, with very few of whom have probably ever entered. All of whom were related to a huge piece of shit who made your daughters eat you when you died. Unable to rebel for eons because of forced slave conditioning. With the only scenery in that wasteland being a sky full of an endless number of branching paths which signal the continuing endless labor and buckets of sand you have to go through. \nIshiyama only needed a few pages to convey how that eternity must have felt like. And he only needed two panels of Yimir\'s actually face and expression to convey what finally having the courage and strength to escape that eternity must feel like. \n\nI\'ve always felt that the justifications for the rumbling from a last option tactical stand point were okay, but very weak from an emotional standpoint. Ishiyama is a true genius and he made me change my view point in one chapter. \nNow I\'m all for the rumbling despite the fact that it will probably end in the deaths of unimaginable number of innocents. I am probably still against the rumbling itself from that good vs evil stand point, but I can\'t find myself disagreeing with the choice yimir made, knowing her story. That\'s how good this chapter\'s paneling, story telling, and art was. This is in my opinion the best chapter of SNK so far and probably one of the greatest manga chapters of all time. \n\nOn another note, the wording was vague enough in both the translation and the raws that the "world" Eren refers to could also refer to this wasteland they are in and not the physical world. I feel like Eren was probably referring to this wasteland and not the actual physical world as destroying the physical world would not mean the end of Yimir\'s endless labor as long as more titans are being made. Although both could happen at the same time as well. I think the story will end with Yimir ultimately gaining her freedom either with the help of Eren or freeing herself. With Yimir finally moving on, or advancing towards something if you will.']

I wonder if Freida had memories going all the way back to Ymir, and was aware of the real fate of the girl in her storybook.\n\n2. Wait, did Ymir have her tongue removed or was it just the adult slaves?\n\n3. So there's no 'devil of earth'? No aliens or scientific bio-weapon program. Ymir bonded with some magical, glowing underwater worm. That's a little anti-climatic.\n\n4. And this is where the Eldian myths diverge from reality: Ymir really did do all the things they credit her for: But she was never a queen; she was just another slave of Eldia. THIS is why she serves the will of the royal family \ninside the Paths.\n\n5. Any titan shifter could have survived that spear wound. I wonder if Ymir did not regenerate from it because she wasn't aware she had that power in human form, or because she just wanted to die and willed herself not to regenerate.\n\n6. Unbelievable. Eren took his quest for freedom to the ultimate limit and freed Ymir from the Paths. This was beyond my wildest expectations. And TBH I'm not sure this is good writing because it feels like he talk-no-jutsu'ed her out of a 2000-year blood pact with just a few generic lines. It was too easy.\n\n7. Wait... Did Ymir foresee Eren's appearance there to free her, 2000 years ago? Is that what he means by her 'leading' him there and waiting for this?\n\n8. Again it feels like a bit of a stretch that in 2000 years nobody who entered the paths bothered to look into Ymir's past or talk to her. We know that there were at least some earlier members of the royal family who were decent people.\n\n9. Finally Eren's dream is realized... Or is it? We still don't know what he actually plans to do. Does he want to destroy the whole world? Or just the other countries? Or does he mean the current world order?\n\nThere are probably only a few chapters left after this.\n\n1. I can't see Reiner and Pieck doing much besides maybe escaping with Magath, Gabi and Falco.\n\n2. Annie has been completely useless to the plot. There isn't any point even if she wakes up now.\n\n3. Zeke will probably transform again and attack Eren, trying to get back to the Paths to stop Ymir. This is probably where Levi reappears to fulfil his promise to Erwin.\n\n4. The real twist will be how Isayama resolves the war and the future fate of the Eldians and their relationship with the rest of the world."]

[596, 111, 'There are lot of confusion surrounding around the whole ymir situation, so I will try my best to explain some common questions-\n\nWhy ymir did not rebelled against eldian kings in last 2000 last years? \n\nAnswer- Ymir by her nature is a slave to Royal Family, and will of the holder of the founding Titan.From all this time, only members of the Royal Family could get into her contact in the paths dimension as they were only one who inherited the power of founding Titan, she had no other option but to obey there commands. \n\nSo what is different, now?  Why ymir suddenly broke free? \n\nAnswer- EREN.Through out history of aot only members of Royal Family could contact ymir, as they strictly kept the powers of founding Titan within there family and used that power to kept ymir imprisoned in the paths dimension and used her as a slave. Members of the Royal Family from different eras, continued this practice for different reasons. \n\nThe kings who inherited founding Titan before 145th eldian king, did this cause they wanted to maintain there rule over the world. \n\nThe kings who inherited founding Titan after 145th king did this out of there fear. They feared that if founding gets into hand of some one else, he will restart the war and will destroy the "peace", that was established after the 145th king dissolved the eldian empire. \n\nHowever eren is different, eren is the first NON-ROYAL BLOODED person who not only have the powers of the founding Titan, but also managed to make a contact with ymir in the paths dimension, and unlike other holders of the founding Titan, eren actually allows ymir to decide her own fate, and ymir decides to rebel. \n\nWait, Zeke is also there and he is Royal blooded, why ymir is not obeying his orders? \n\nAnswer- yes Zeke is a Royal blood, but he doesn\'t wield the power of the founding Titan, eren does. And ymir is personification of that power. Traditionally, holders of the founding Titan were from Royal Family, who had there own goals and ideologies which was different than ymir\'s, so ymir had to work accordingly to will of holder of the founding Titan, she had no choice\n\nHowever in this chapter, eren convinced ymir to break free from her prison and rebel against the cruel world. This is really an historical event In the series, as in first time in the history of aot verse, the founding Titan and the guy who holds the power of founding Titan, are on the same page and have same goals and ideologies. This unique situation allowed ymir to fully bond with the holder of founding Titan ( that is eren) and break free from her prison, despite Zeke\'s orders.']

Of course, KnY has some comedic faces and characters as well, it’s just the arcs and tone are more intense, plot driven, and serious.\n\nAs for the quality, I think it is definitely better than your average shonen but the plot is pretty simplistic (just fighting demons). Final arc, if it is the final arc, seems to be cramming in a lot of things too. The heroine hardly shines.']
[615, 3, 'Depends a lot on what you mean when you say "serious"... I think its a decent shounen title that executes its premise well and was capable of keeping me interested over the last year or so. It has its ups and downs, but generally speaking it does a good job in the story and character development department. I\'d say it lack a bit in the world building compared to BnHA, but honestly, there are a lot of titles that do. \n\nPersonally, I\'d probably rank it lower than BnHA. I find the side characters more engaging, the main cast more fun to watch and the story, for the most part, better (even tough the last year or so was certainly not BnHA prime time). I also like BnHA artwork better, but this is arguably a matter of taste.\n\nIf you are thinking about starting the KnY, I strongly recommend the Anime. I think it does a great job, so there really are no downsides to starting there and see if you like it.']

Also, the situation with the King is also something contrived to just explore more relationship drama when logically all it would take to sort any problem would be something like a tenth of good old Mom and Dad's overwhelming power. \n\nAt first I kind of thought the setting was interesting but now that we're 13 chapters into it I feel like it's very much just a convoluted mess that only exists because it seems that these types of stories demand that **they must** or they're not on genre anymore. \n\nAs other people have pointed out - the kings antagonism of this family is utterly retarded. Yet apparently from the dialogue in this episode we, the readers, are supposed to take this as a credible threat to Ellen and her family. The reason this doesn't work is because of the setting - the main characters are all so overwhelmingly powerful that it's pretty easy to imagine that even Ellen herself might be capable of destroying the entire kingdom if she put her mind to it. With that kind of setting how are we supposed to take this seriously? \n\nI dunno, from the original intro of this story I thought that it was going to be more clever than this - it made it seem like Ellen's parents would be in trouble and that she would be spending her time trying to prevent people from screwing with them. That's kind of true in a way since this **does** happen, but the stakes are just mega dumb.  To make a bad analogy, it would be like reading a story about Batman saving Superman from the threats posed by a slightly angry group of middle school delinquents. That's the level of disparity between the power of the protagonists and the antagonists in this story and it's kind of boring and stupid."]

[711, 5, "<Jitsu wa Watashi wa> is IMO one of the best romcom manga of all time.\n\nIt's a really really great (finished) romcom, that doesn't start particularly strong sadly (which became a big issue for it, because the anime adaptation only adapted that early part where it still feels kinda generic, so a lot of people skipped over it, also because some people mistakenly tag it as a harem which it very much isn't) but it gets better and better as the story goes, and it has one of the best finales I've ever seen in anything, topped with some chapters of epilogue after it as well.\n\nWhile the story of course has a lot of supernatural elements, the relationships between the characters felt a lot more relatable than in most other romcoms, both between the main couple (which not only does get established, but it's also way less dragged out than in most cases, especially since there's more of the manga after it happens than before) but also the side characters, which are all surprisingly fleshed out, and all of the important side characters have their own things and relationships, and their own little stories that makes it feel much more like they're actually there and have their own lives instead of just being around the main characters.\n\nThe story is really great, and the comedy is done very well too, plus I think most of the characters are very entertaining and likeable, and are not just one dimensional. Also, there's pretty much no bullshit misunderstanding based drama, every problem that comes up feels understandable.\n\nAfter the last time I reread I confirmed it that it is very much my favourite manga ever, and I try to recommend it every chance I get."]

Don't tell me that one of the Yonko themselves came over to deal with them.....oof. Or maybe Queen and King did something? My theory is that they're all in Udon's Prisoner Mines, but for real this time.\n\nIf the Akazaya Nine leave to Onigashima without backup like Inuarashi suggests, then Orochi has effectively singled out the exact nemeses that Toki's prophecy claims would lead to his ruin. They'll be gathered up at the Festival for Orochi to confirm their deaths...\n\nAlthough Nekomamushi is missing, so I'm not sure if that means he arrived overnight and has simply been thwarted as well, or if he's genuinely sidetracked with something.

Also, there's pretty much no bullshit misunderstanding based drama, every problem that comes up feels understandable.\n\nAfter the last time I reread I confirmed it that it is very much my favourite manga ever, and I try to recommend it every chance I get."]

Like, the biggest conflict until he appeared was Legosi trying to live as a highschool dropout, a very mature theme and with limitless potential for drama. Thing is, as soon as this guy showed up all conflict and drama went from subtle and personal to over the top and nonsensical. It went from Legosi getting to know his neighbors and maintaining his new relationship to Legosi getting shot at a private party and making friends with the Mafia group he fought before with. Does anyone wonder what happened to his job? Did he just quit? Did he get paid for the job he did with the horse man (Can\'t remember his name right now)? All of this mature drama is casted aside for, while in context serious, childish action like Legosi\'s grandpa fighting gangsters that become irrelevant not 3 chapters later and Legosi getting kidnapped by the man he\'s chasing because he pulled a 4D move on him because he knew that he would be followed. I know people will tell me that the manga is filled with such content at given points, but mostly those moments were somehow connected to the principal plot: who killed Tem. This guy just came out of nowhere one chapter and has been the center point since then. I would be okay if the plot hadn\'t introduced this new turn of events so drastically and actually treated it with the respect it needs. Like, this guy whole deal is that he kills just because. There\'s no inner conflict nor reason as to why he started doing it so far, he\'s just an edgy bad guy with no redeeming qualities despite his "bond" with Legosi and has been able to sustain a normal life no problem.']

[736, 36, 'First I want to give my opinion on the match. I waited a week since the score wasn\'t shown in the previous chapter and I didn\'t wanna rush it before it\'s confirmed Karasuno\'s lost. So, I\'d say one of my favorite matches so far. The level of volleyball mixed in with amazing emotional chapters... And the fanbase being split in their opinion whether Karasuno would win or lose added more excitement/tension which was good. Hinata\'s development was just amazing, he shined so bright. He was undoubtedly the MVP on Karasuno\'s side. Kags did great, Azumane\'s development was spot-on, Tsukki being motivated to defeat the Little Giant... the different layers of the different rivalries and character developments were done beautifully on Karasuno\'s side. Kamomedai... great team great potential, but I\'m a bit disappointed in them. There was so much more room for them to shine.\n\nGao was featured as the 2nd star of the team, yet he felt so underwhelming. He started off good, he was scoring in the 1st set, the double jump block to finish the set as well... and then nothing.\xa0 Furudate made that unreasonable thing where Karasuno\'s faced a 2m guy before, and that\'s why they are dealing with him fine. And that\'s a bs thing. Height is a very strong weapon for a reason. That one time in 364 where he absolutely disregarded Tanaka\'s block and spiked above it was something we should\'ve seen a lot more. He deserved more double panels for himself as well.\n\nBessho. Absolute disappointment with that character. All the 1st years in powerhouse teams have always shown why they are regulars/special. He\'s a MB in the best blocking team in Japan, yet he did close to nothing. When he was the one to touch Hinata\'s minus tempo spike in the 2nd or 3rd point of the match I was like... this is probably the guy that\'d give Hinata the most trouble, yet... nothing followed. I expected a lot more from that character.\xa0 In fact, he was my main guess as to who was going to play a major part in Kamomedai\'s victory. \n\nHoshiumi started off good, played amazingly. I love the chapter where he said "I am Hoshiumi Korai". He was so overwhelming, people were in awe of his skills. I really expected him to have more moments/chapters like that near the end of the match. I\'m not sure why Furudate decided to give him nearly no spotlight near the end of the match. And Hoshiumi completely stopped doing wipes after Tsukki dodged it once. And that is bs. Hoshiumi got so many points with wipes, being read once... happens... he could\'ve just aimed at another blocker\'s hands. Also his backstory was quite... simple. That flashback I mean. I feel like he should\'ve gotten 1 more flashback in order for us to get a bit more in-depth look at his backstory and why he is who he is today.\n\nHirugami was the best handled character from Kamomedai imo. His backstory is so relatable and addresses issues a lot of people deal with throughout their life. I loved how Furudate was willing to push it and show Hirugami dragging his hand on the wall leaving a bloody mark. You could really feel Hirugami\'s struggle right there. Anyways, he was handled great as the best blocker we\'ve seen so far as well. Imo we saw the most intimidating killblock in the series (so far) from him. I loved everything about him. It took Karasuno more than 2 sets to bait him completely and break the block apart. The only thing I didn\'t like is that he got no spotlight whatsoever after Hinata left the court. Without the greatest decoy on the court Hirugami should\'ve gone wild and immovable again. I\'m sad we didn\'t see that.\n\nNozawa... I completely fell in love with the guy. I\'m quite sad this is the last time we\'ll be seeing him in action. He went out with a bang at least. \n\nI hope next year we see Kamomedai getting a top calibre setter. Hoshiumi had to deal with imperfect tosses so many times. Getting an amazing 1st year setter would be such a boost. And a great challenge for Kags as a setter.\n\nAbout the chapter itself... what a panel that last one is... breathtaking. Hinata looks so mature. Ah, I\'m so excited.\n\nNo offense to Bokuto, but I hope the Nationals arc ends in a few chapters. I\'m just so excited for the upcoming year...\n\nItachiyama... whoever has kept up with my comments for a long time would know I was the most excited to see them play and my prediction was that they\'d win the whole thing. So yeah, I\'m salty about it. Because the only reason I see for eliminating them like that is to push Bokuto forward and have him win it all as a fan service since the guy is liked by the majority of Haikyuu fans. If both Karasuno and Fuku lost a lot of people would be upset and Furudate would face quite the backlash from his fans. But by having the 2nd fan favorite team win Nationals he somewhat would keep the fans satisfied. This is all I could think of as the reason why Furudate did it. And that annoys me even more. But I\'m willing to wait and see if Furudate did it as a fan service or has a grand plan behind that bold decision. And if anybody actually sees another reason why I\'m more than willing to hear it. Maybe atm I could be blinded with my annoyance.\n\nBut I tip my hat to Furudate regardless. Even while offscreening the team I\'ve been so excited to see... he writes it beautifully. I give credit where credit\'s due.']

[736, 44, "Now that is officially over, Kamomedai is by far the weakest big match in the series and Hoshiumi the weakest atangonist too, not in terms of ability but as a character. The team was also incredibly boring and forgettable having only two interesting members in Hoshiumi, and the better character in my opinion Hirugami. Hoshiumi brought the cool concept of height but I felt it contradicted his character, he said he didn't care about height yet he did had a height complex and other than the height plot point....he didn't bring much to the table, as a character. That's all he was.  Asahi, Tsukishima and Hirugami were definitely the heights of this arc, loved them."]

Even after her trial, she seems to show little remorse for her actions and constantly tries to forget about murdering her own son. It seemed to me that she felt more pain for being caught and gaining public ridicule than killing her own flesh and blood. Not once does she spend time to reflect that being a mother came with responsibilities, leading her to discard him like a toy once he no longer amused her.\n\nThese actions make her unforgivable in my eyes, and I dislike how this manga seems to harp that all people are capable of redemption.

There are people in this world who absolutely do not deserve redemption and should spend the rest of their lives with an anchor over their necks."]

[795, 5, "Hard agree, but with the addition that even from the get-go I thought the manga was pretty average. Komi was decently fun at the start when it focused on less characters but unfortunately the way that the mangaka has executed on the main premise doomed it from the start. If Komi needs to make 100 friends and every single one of those people is gonna get some time devoted primarily to them that's gonna lead to reader burnout. You end up without the time to make those 100 people interesting or complex (which is why every character in Komi is named after their sole defining personality trait) and also drag focus away from the development of the characters we actually give a shit about. Some people don't mind if their SoL is wandering with no direction but it annoys me after a while, which is why Horimiya has also become a bit of a drag (but at least it has less characters it needs to focus on and already developed relationships between them before it started doing this).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSenryuu Shoujo does the cute girl with a communication problem thing infinitely better, complete with a smaller cast that all have more personality than every Komi character combined and better art. Her issues are less severe than Komi's, but the fact that Nanako actually does communicate allows her to have an interesting personality."]

[795, 7, "I agree with your points about how Komi isn't improving anymore- All the progress she's made is out the window, and she's back at square one with minimal communication. If the original intent was to help her communicate better, why are they seemingly content with the fact that she still can't greet others or have a conversation?"]
[795, 8, 'i pretty much agree, except that her “one flaw” is not even a flaw anymore. Komi actually can communicate pretty much fine by writing and gesturing. she has had plenty of great, emotionally intelligent conversations with other characters (Manbagi, Yamai) by writing. \n\ni guess what keeps me reading is that i really do enjoy it as a comedy, and i really like all of the side characters. i don’t love how the author introduces a new one every other chapter, but i do really enjoy the side characters generally. \n\nin fact, i think the worst part about Komi-san manga... is Komi. her character is the least interesting of all of the one million characters. i would rather the series focus completely on Tadano, Najimi, or Manbagi (or my personal best girl, Ase). i’ll keep reading because i do really enjoy the comedy, but Komi will continue to be my least favorite lolol']
[795, 9, 'I agree. Komi-san\'s original goal was to make 100 friends, but what good is that if Komi doesn\'t learn from this and thereby improve her social skills? On top of that, MOST her newer "friends" get a panel of screen time and are tossed aside until they\'re convenient again. A mile wide and an inch deep on that front.\n\nThat being said I feel way too invested to stop reading now. It just feels like we\'re moving at a snail\'s pace in terms of plot and character development.']

At first I thought Manbagi is going to trigger something between Tadano and Komi but now the only difference she made is going from "Komi and Tadano doing cute stuff together" to "Komi, Tadano and Manbagi are doing cute stuff together". Its just so borring, yeah Komi is cute we understood that like 200chapters ago, if the author just wants to make cute reaction faces for memeing than just do it in pixiv oneshots and dont write a manga with such meaningless "plot" around it.']

York[1] (born June 26, 1945[2][3]), also known as Malachi Z. York, Issa Al Haadi Al Mahdi, Dr. York, et alii, is an American criminal, musician, and writer who is known as the founding leader of various religious/political groups, including most notably the United Nation of Nuwaubian Moors, a religious ministry/Native American tribe that has existed in some form since the 1960s.[4][5] He is a convicted child molester.\n\nHe and his group were based in Brooklyn, New York. Around 1990 the community relocated to rural Putnam County, Georgia, where they built a large complex. York was convicted in 2004 of child molestation and violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.[6] He is serving a 135-year sentence.\n\n...\n\nYork was arrested in May 2002. In 2004 he was convicted on federal charges of transporting minors across state lines for the purposes of sexual molestation, as well as racketeering and financial reporting violations. York's case was reported as the largest prosecution for child molestation ever directed at a single person in the history of the United States, both in terms of number of victims and number of incidents. \n\n...\n\nIn early 2003 York's lawyer had him evaluated by a forensic psychologist, who diagnosed a DSM-IV impression consisting of Axis I – Clinical Syndrome of Delusional (Paranoid) Disorder, Generalized anxiety disorder, Adjustment disorder with depressed mood, and Axis II – personality disorders; histrionic personality traits, self-defeating personality traits, and schizotypal personality features.[30]"]

Then he'd be right back where he was. Is his plan to just keep stubbornly living out lifetimes and reincarnating until he lucks into a more talented body? I would have at least gone for a cheat that guarantees talent to skip the BS since you're already cheating anyways.

Ants are formidable warriors (for their size), and if scaled to human size, their tough skin (pretty much armor) would be impenetrable to a tiger's claw.\n\nCould also be a flying creature, but it brings us to the same place I think... Unless it's a dinosaur or an insect, I'm not sure what could be threatening. \n\nLast option I'm thinking about; Something that doesn't sound strong at first glance, but is actually real fucking strong when scaled up. \n\nEither way it's gotta be something 'special' given how they hype her and still hide her identity. I'd be surprised if it was just some random beast.\n\nEdit: She seemed reticent about making a mess, so didn't want to fully transform... So maybe it is something huge after all? Or maybe a plant hah. The roots would obviously make a mess.\n\nBut if it's something huge and she only partially transforms (another dinosaur) would tiger really lose to a little girl with a big dinosaur mouth? He was too fast for that, wasn't he? He'd dodge anything...\n\nMaybe a bee, then? Didn't want to transform because she couldn't fly in an enclosed space, but her sting could easily kill Tiger in one hit."]

Akaza in particular is my favourite villain of all shounen and in general the villains are much more memorable than those of BC ( Except of the last one who is AMAZING ). The main cast is better in BC , as in they have more synergy with each other in the story.

[847, 1, "I think there's a different, bigger problem that would have to be solved first, which is the existing body of work for Marvel and DC. A longstanding problem is the barrier of entry - it's hard to just jump in. Manga have a tendency to start fresh, disconnected from any wider canon, or to at least have a solid, chronological numbering that you can follow, grab volume 1 and start. Fate nonwithstanding, of course.\n\nSo long as this existing body is the primary business of the comic industry, they'll want to keep control over it, and it'll stay a mess. As such, I don't think any other publishing system can work for the established industry. Change would have to come from outside, and the most important part would probably be accessibility."]
[847, 2, ">  if a creator wishes to pitch a new creative work it's almost an  impossible endeavor, and independent publishing of ones' creative work  requires a lot of hardships. \n\nBecause that's what the readership wants. Superman and Wolverine keep coming back to life for the same reasons that Goku does, fans don't like changes despite what they can say.\n\n> Many decisions are also decided by editors and executives, rather than the creator; it is also the higher ups that decide which works are favored or alienated without careful consideration of readership.\n\nThe same can be said of the manga industry."]

Chapters are for the most part are episodic in nature, with some continuity, and readers are presented with seemingly normal situations that end with a twist they don't expect, Which is arguably the best part of the manga. Sidenote : not for the sqeamish or those who want to skip a depressing read as the manga is pretty cynical and generally portrays the worst aspects of human nature.

The both of them decided to help her out.\n\n- Mafuyu then invited both Nariyuki and Fumino into her place for some tea. Nariyuki, however, was worried because he hasn\'t come to help her to clean due to exam and being injured. He was surprised to see how clean the place was, and thought she had grown...but she merely stuffed her stuff in the closet. He then try to prevented Fumino from seeing the closet.\n\n- Mafuyu then started teaching Nariyuki and Fumino. Fumino was happy as it was due to Nariyuki that they were able to gain Mafuyu\'s support. However, Fumino started to suspect something when she noticed that Nariyuki knew where the snack was located, Nariyuki and Mafuyu are using the paired mugs while she got the one for guests, and Mafuyu wearing a certain apron when cooking curry. Feeling jealous and doesn\'t want to lose, Fumino decided to also cook curry, and see who made it better.\n\n- Though Fumino was not planning to get Nariyuki to help because he\'s still injured, after she cut her finger, Nariyuki came to her aid, and it turn into a close contact situation. Mafuyu, wondering what\'s going on between the two, accidentally dazed off, forgot the next step, and accidentally let curry burn while she searched for her recipe book.\n\n- Meanwhile, Fumino added too much oil while cooking Tempura, and the pan was on fire.\n\n- In the end, both of their curry was a huge failure, and both of them disparaged each other\'s curry. Nariyuki, who tried both of their curry, gave them advice on what they should be careful of next time, and smiled as he hoped that they\'d make them together on a friendly term. Fumino was both embarrassed and irritated by Nariyuki\'s usual "Mr. Nice Guy" attitude, while Mafuyu noted that is how Nariyuki is.\n\n- Fumino and Mafuyu then made another batch of curry with each other, where Fumino\'s the one who searched for the recipe. Fumino then tried it out first, and gaved out an expression of it tasting good. Mafuyu accidentally let out that they should do this again at any time, was embarrassed by what she said, and tried to mislead them.\n\n- Nariyuki and Mafuyu then tried the curry, but fainted. The reason, the recipe that Fumino searched was a super spicy one.\n\nTranslated By: LadyRuneReader']

Everyone would have to deal with their problems without him and then he'd eventually make a triumphant return. But does the series really need that?

If I could give this novel a negative five, I would! On the very first day, the chick colludes with the inn employees, drugs MC and rpes him. After he wakes up, and this is literally in the fucking novel, he says it\'s pointless to be angry, she is super cute and his type, he doesn\'t mind to be her puppet and marries her almost on the spot. And he keeps staying at that inn, where people schemed against him, without minding anything. And later we find out that it was the same fucking god that summoned MC got this girl to drug him and rpe him. The god says she a good girl and it took him a while to convince her. Yes, because only good people get others drugged and r*ped. If I was summoned to this damn world and was told I can be a hero or a villain or whatever I wanna be, I would go ahead and destroy everything, because why the heck not if everyone in there is a damn insane criminal, including the gods. Then, in just a few chapters like a total moron, he exposes himself as an OP hero and then runs away from the city. The kingdom sent 30 assassins after him, who are then killed by MC, except for one chick, who MC tortures and brutally rpes for information. Right after this, he goes right back to the city where he escaped from, meets with the king and starts fucking work for the king who tried to kill him. And not only that, he saw the assassin chick in the slave shop and byes her because he feels responsible that he ruined her life. I cannot even make this sht up. Just what kind of mental patient wrote this novel? And what happened next? The princess of the kingdom that tried to kill him tries to drug him and rpe him, which he knowingly almost lets happen all the way through!

Vol 6 prequel story is one of the best stand alone volumes in any isekai series I have read.\n\nLog horizon- take the video game concept but don't have an op infallible best player main protagonist. Amazing world building, along with civilization and government establishment. \n\nDevil is a part-timer-Switching things up by making otherworlders come to present day earth. reverse isekai taking overpowered people and making them live the everyday struggle without those powers. The conflict of the devil and hero that questions the boundaries and distinctions of good and evil, when otherworlders intervene in their normal peaceful lives. \n\nOverlord- Its another great world builder, with amazingly developed  in depth characters. The villain perspective while not being self aware that they are the villain. The subordinates being completely off base with the intent of their ruler and creator, makes for hilarious and interesting developments in their world conquest. \n\nKonosuba- It subverts the entire isekai genre. makes a complete farce of the hero's journey. Its self deprecating in a humorous way. Takes all the tropes of generic overpowered isekai characters and trashes them, makes something amazing without taking itself seriously. \n\n\nHonorable mentions\nRe:zero- mc retains his normalcy. Doesn't gain overpowered boost to take everything on himself. It is very much like learning a level in old school video games. \n\nSo I  am a spider so what-I enjoy the monster perspective like that time I was reincarnated as a slime but better. There is a sense of tension that the spider could die that slime didn't really have. The story from the other students' perspective has been good too, in a way that arifureta fell short. \n\nDefeating the demon lord is a cinch if you've got a ringer- I have only read the first volume so far.

[934, 6, "Is it bad that, of all the characters, my favorite one is **Margaret**?\n\nSure, Miss Punching Bag is there for comedic relief, a butt monkey whose ambitions outstrip her competence. She's the catalyst for this series' events. Yet she's also funny and lively and, honestly, I can see her point.\n\n* Already in ch. 2 she pointed out that Rachel mustn't be right in the head when her first impulse when meeting someone is to punch them (and she's right; Rachel is a bonafide psychopath).\n\n* She isn't wrong either that relationships between fiances aren't precisely very good, yet they complain when their partners have eyes for prospects that treat them with some degree of niceness.\n\n* Her backstory explains a lot. Sure, going after another person's fiance is a jerkass move, but marrying into prestige was the way she escaped the slums. And she's right that the world is arranged to favor nobles.\n\nThe later part of the chapter proves her right in every regard. Even if Martina loves Sykes, she treats him like a punching bag (and it's not the first time). It's Margaret who tries to stop the fight and save Sykes, and she almost loses her head in the process. And what punishment doed Martina face for her long list of crimes? Nothing, even if everyone is aware she'd deserve at least three life terms."]
